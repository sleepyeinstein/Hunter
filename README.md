# Hunter
A small script for my recon during bug hunting/pentesting

More things need to be added in it like directory scan, subdomain bruteforce etc.

For using it,
- Change the line variable at 99th line to the path where you want to save the target data.
- Create a scope named file in the same place as multi.sh and add the domain in it like yahoo.com
- Tools needed(Add them in you environment PATH variable or edit the location in script) : 
  webscreenshot.py
  amass
  sublister.py
  Nmap
